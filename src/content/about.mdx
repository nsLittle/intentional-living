  I’m Little. Mother, home cook, and creator of Simple Intentions, a quiet corner of the web inspired by the warmth of Vermont’s simple living.

  A space to share recipes, seasonal foraging finds, and reflections on intentional living. With my daughters beside me, we savor small joys. Laughter in the kitchen, wild mushrooms in a basket, and meals made with love and simplicity.

  Simple Intentions is a journal of those moments. From pantry blends to backyard treasures, each post is a celebration of slow, homemade magic, and the belief that simple intentions create a rich, joyful life.

  Thank you for wandering through these pages. I hope they bring a bit of comfort, inspiration, or spark to your own table.

  With warmth,

  Little
