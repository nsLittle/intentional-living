  I’m a mother, home cook, crafter, opportunistic forager and creator of Simple Intentions, a quiet corner of the web inspired by the warmth of Vermont’s simple living.

  A space to share recipes, seasonal foraging finds, and reflections on intentional living. With my daughters beside me, we savor small joys. Laughter in the kitchen, wild mushrooms in a basket, and meals made with love and simplicity.

  Why Simple Intentions?  Because life is full and noisy, and I want a home that feels steady. 

  This project is my practice of choosing less-but-better—cooking from what we have, honoring Vermont’s seasons, and teaching my girls simple systems they can repeat. 

  Here you’ll find pantry-first recipes, safe and respectful foraging notes, and small rituals that make ordinary days feel cared for.

  Simple Intentions is a journal of those moments. From pantry blends to backyard treasures, each post is a celebration of slow, homemade magic, and the belief that simple intentions create a rich, joyful life.

  Thank you for wandering through these pages. I hope they bring a bit of comfort, inspiration, or spark to your own table.

  With warmth,

  Little
