  I’m a mother, home cook, crafter, opportunistic forager and creator of Simple Intentions, a quiet corner of the web inspired by the warmth of Vermont’s simple living.

  This is a space to share pantry-first recipes, seasonal foraging notes, crafty projects, and reflections on intentional living. With my daughters beside me, we savor small joys. Laughter in the kitchen, wild mushrooms in a basket, and meals made with love and simplicity.

  Why Simple Intentions?  Because life is noisy, and I want a home that feels steady. And I do so with as much intention and simplicity as I can.

  This project is my practice of choosing less-but-better.  Cooking from what we have, honoring Vermont’s seasons, and teaching my girls simple systems they can repeat. 

  Here you’ll find pantry blends, safe and respectful foraging notes, and small rituals that make ordinary days feel cared for.

  Simple Intentions is a journal of those moments. From pantry blends to backyard treasures, each post is a celebration of slow, homemade magic, and the belief that simple intentions create a rich, joyful life.

  Thank you for wandering through these pages. I hope they bring a bit of comfort, inspiration, or spark to your own table.

  With warmth,
  Little
