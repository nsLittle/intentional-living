  My all time classic - the ballband dishie clothes. I first found this pattern years ago on Canadian Living, and Iâ€™ve been making it ever since.  

  Always with Dishie cotton yarn from Knit Picks. At this point, Iâ€™ve made every color combination under the sun.

  My kitchen drawers are full of them, and they get daily use â€” wiping counters, drying dishes, and generally making themselves indispensable.
