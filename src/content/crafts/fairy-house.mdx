  Every few seasons, my girls and I build fairy houses to scatter around our woods.  It's a little touch of whimsy that fills my heart when I'm outside breathing in the universe.

  Made with little bits of this and that, including buttons, dried moss, sea shells, pinecorns, ribbons, and other found bits from our craft room or the woods.

time:
  prep: "10 min"
  make: "30â€“45 min"
difficulty: "Easy"
materials:
  - "Twigs, bark, pinecones, pebbles, sea shells (gather only fallen materials)"
  - "Dried moss, leaves, acorn caps"
  - "Buttons, ribbon, scrap fabric"
  - "Non-toxic craft paint & small brushes"
  - "Glue gun or E600 waterproof glue"
  - "Small wood homes, or create your own using bits or cardboard, cans, or styrofoam (base, optional)"
