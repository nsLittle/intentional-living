  Something...

  Materials:
  - 1 mason jar with lid
  - 2 cups of 110 proof vodka
  - freshly foraged ghost pipes

  Instructions:
  - Take the jar of alcohol with you to the foraging site.  You will want to immediately place the ghost pipes into the jar to prevent bruising.

  - Only take a stem or two from any one clump.  Do not forage more than what you need.  Do not forage more than a fifth of what you find. This years growth is what fuels future blooms.
