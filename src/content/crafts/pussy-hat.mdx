  We all love the one skein wonders that can also double as the best gifts ever.

  The Pussy Hat fits the bill for just about every girl and woman and ally of female health.

  Make it in any pink yarn you have, knit flat then two little seams to sew in, and voila.  The cutest little hat in the world.

  Who doesn't want little kitty ears to keep our heads warm all winter?  And the best thing is this pattern supports women's health.

  Go, Pussy!
