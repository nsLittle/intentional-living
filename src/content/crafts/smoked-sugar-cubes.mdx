  Homemade sugar cubes are the quintessential homemade easy peasy gift.  Give it a twist of spice with classic chai flavors!

  Materials:
  - 1 cup white, cane, or brown sugar
  - 2 teaspoons smoke tincture
  - 2 teaspoons water
  - silicone molds of your choice

  Instructions:
  - Mix sugar and water until thoroughly mixed and it feels like damp sand.
  - Press and pack sugar into candy molds.
  - Dry overnight and pop sugar cubes out of molds.
  - Transfer into a mason jar and decorate with tags and twine.
