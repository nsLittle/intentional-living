  My girls and I love afternoon tea.  I grew up in colonial Hong Kong, and I have the fondest of memories of my mother and I spending an afternoon at the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon over the prettiest tiers of finger sandwiches, little scones with cream and jams, and of course the delicately poured tea!

  While there is a Governor's House a few towns over in Hyde Park, Vermont with the loveliest of afternoon tea service offered by the ever-proper Inn Keeper, Suzanne, my girls and I enjoy our own little version at home.
