  I love keeping my hands busy, even when Iâ€™m relaxing. Quiet evenings are often spent with an audiobook and a knitting project.

  More often than not, the project is the classic ballband dishcloth. I first found this pattern years ago on <a href="https://www.canadianliving.com/home-and-garden/knitting-and-crochet/article/knit-a-ballband-dishcloth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Living</a>, and Iâ€™ve been making it ever since.  

  Always with Dishie 100% cotton yarn from <a href="https://www.knitpicks.com/yarn/dishie/c/5420207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knit Picks</a>. Not only does Knit Picks have a lovely assorted of solid colors, their Dishie yarn in worsted weight comes in a selection of variegated fun colorways. At this point, Iâ€™ve made every color combination under the sun.

  My kitchen drawers are full of My Dishie Clothes, and they get daily use from wiping counters, drying dishes, and generally making themselves indispensable.
