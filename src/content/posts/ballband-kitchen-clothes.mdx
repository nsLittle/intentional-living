  I love keeping my hands busy, even when Iâ€™m relaxing. Quiet evenings are often spent with music or an audiobook playing, knitting away at the same familiar project. 

  For me, thatâ€™s the classic ballband dishcloth. I first found this pattern years ago on <a href="https://www.canadianliving.com/home-and-garden/knitting-and-crochet/article/knit-a-ballband-dishcloth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Living</a>, and Iâ€™ve been making it ever since.  

  Always with Dishie cotton yarn from <a href="https://www.knitpicks.com/yarn/dishie/c/5420207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knit Picks</a>. At this point, Iâ€™ve made every color combination under the sun.

  My kitchen drawers are full of them, and they get daily use â€” wiping counters, drying dishes, and generally making themselves indispensable.

  ðŸ§¶ <a href="/crafts/ballband-kitchen-clothes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballband Dishie Clothes</a> for endless knitting with my simple pattern.
