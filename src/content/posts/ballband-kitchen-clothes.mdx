I love keeping my hands busy, even when Iâ€™m relaxing. Quiet evenings are often spent with music or an audiobook playing, knitting away at the same familiar project."
textTwo: "For me, thatâ€™s the classic ballband dishcloth. I first found this pattern years ago on Canadian Living, and Iâ€™ve been making it ever since â€” always with Dishie cotton yarn from Knit Picks. At this point, Iâ€™ve made every color combination under the sun.

My kitchen drawers are full of them, and they get daily use â€” wiping counters, drying dishes, and generally making themselves indispensable.

If youâ€™re a knitter (or want to be), hereâ€™s the pattern and my favorite yarn source:
