  Living in Vermont, we're careful about when we put out our bird feeders.  Black bears are opportunistic foragers, and a bounty of suet and seeds are a bear's delight!

  The rule of thumb is if it's been "wintery" long enough for a bear to hibernate, with snow accumulation holding for a few weeks, you can probably put out bird feed without attracting bears.

  In calendar time, that's about December 1 through March 31.  But it's hard telling, not knowing.
