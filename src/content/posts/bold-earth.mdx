  I’m notoriously both lazy and busy. While I love the romance of an all-day simmering sauce, the slow bubblings of a pot on the stove, the kitchen filled with tantalizing scents, most days are too hectic for that kind of cooking.

  That’s where my jars of go-to spice mixes quietly save the day. Every so often, my younger daughter and I set aside a Saturday morning to measure, mix, and stir together a few favorite blends.

  It’s a simple ritual: spoonfuls of this and that, a little giggling over the measuring spoons, and neat rows of jars by the time we’re done. 

  Keeping a small stash of pre-made blends makes weeknights effortless.  A sprinkle on chicken or roasted vegetables, a quick sauté, a side or two—and dinner is on the table without the drama.

  My Bold Earth spice mix is a family favorite — a jar of vibrant, warm spices that’s a culinary passport to the rich and storied cultures of North Africa. Each sprinkle carries the earthy heat of the Sahara, the smoky allure of bustling souks, and the sweet, aromatic whispers of ancient trade routes. 

  For a gloriously simple dinner, I sprinkle it over chicken thighs and whatever vegetables the season offers, then roast until tender. Add rice, and you have a meal that’s both grounding and full of quiet adventure.
