  Every few seasons, my girls and I tuck tiny fairy houses around our woods—a small shimmer of wonder that greets us on every walk.

  Built from found bits—twigs, pinecones, pebbles, shells, dried moss, ribbon, buttons—and finished with a quick swipe of paint and a dot of glue, each one feels like a secret we’re sharing with the trees.

  Ready to add a little whimsy?
