  I’m notoriously both lazy and busy. While I do love the romance of an all-day simmering sauce — the slow bubllings of a pot on the stove, the kitchen filled with tantalizing scents — most days are far too hectic for that kind of cooking. 

  That’s where my jars of go-to spice mixes come in as a quiet blessing. Every so often, my younger daughter and I set aside a Saturday morning to measure, mix, and stir together our favorite blends. 

  It’s a simple ritual: spoonfuls of this and that, a little giggling over the spice scale, and jars lined up neatly on the shelf by the time we’re done. 

  Keeping a small stash of pre-made blends makes weeknight dinners effortless. A sprinkle over a piece of chicken or roasted vegetables, a quick sauté, a side or two — and just like that, dinner is on the table without the drama.

  🫙 <a href="/recipes/sweet-harmony">Sweet Harmony</a> adds spiced goodness to baked squash or apple-forward dishes.  

  🍯 <a href="/recipes/savory-soul">Savory Soul</a> is great with chicken or lentils, full of cozy kitchen energy.
