  I continue my Jar series this month with easy entrees that spell COMFORT.  They're all prepped in pretty mason jars, add some protein or coconut milk and you have a hearty meal for any day of the week.

  From Chicken Noodle Soup to Coconut Lentil Curry Soup, each recipe for a pretty jar to gift or keep for those days when you need a little help will have you serving a homemade meal simply.

  I like to pre-assemble a few favorite soup or pasta mixes into mason jars.  These jars of meals make weeknight meal prep so much simpler and stress free.
