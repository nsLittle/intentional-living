  Last month I shared my little kitchen hack for easy weeknight dinners — jars of homemade spice blends, ready for a quick sprinkle here and there.

  This month, we’re leaning into dessert. 🍪 Because sometimes, what you need most is a cookie.

  I like to pre-assemble a few favorite cookie and brownie mixes into mason jars. On days when I crave something homemade but the idea of dragging out flour, sugar, and a dozen little bags feels like too much — these jars save the day.

  🍪 <a href="/recipes/m-and-m-cookies">M&M Cookies</a> — endlessly fun with seasonal color swaps.
  🍪 <a href="/recipes/oatmeal-raisin-cookies">Oatmeal Raisin Cookies</a> — cozy, classic, always satisfying.
  🍪 <a href="/recipes/ultimate-brownies">Ultimate Brownies</a> — decadent and fudgy, no shortcuts on the good stuff.
  🍪 <a href="/recipes/chocolate-cranberry-cookies">Chocolate Cranberry Cookies</a> — because sweet and tart is a thing.
