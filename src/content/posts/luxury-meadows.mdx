  Gathering wildflowers and having them in the house all summer long is the luxury of the meadows.

  No two days yield the same bouquet. Some mornings lean pink, others gold. Always that unruly softness—ferns reaching sideways, Queen Anne’s lace lacing the edges like delicate embroidery. A little wild. A little regal. All of it freely given.

  There’s no map for it—just wandering the fields and back hills, letting your eye catch what it will. The right combination is never planned. It’s a delightful profusion of prettiness and daintiness, assembled by instinct, not instruction.
