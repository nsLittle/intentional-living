  My 10 year old recently came home with a skein of pink fluffy yarn she purchased at the local dollar store.

  "I bought it with my own money!" she declared proudly. "Can you make me something?"

  What is a mother to do?  I went straight to <a href="https://www.ravelry.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ravelry</a> and went searching for a one skein pattern.  Voila, Pussy Hat to the rescue!

  Conceived as a visual unifier for the 2019 Women's Marches, the Pussy Hat is a simple projct knit flat.  The cute hats, to be knit in any variation of PINK, resemble little kitty ears when worn!

  ðŸ§¶ <a href="/crafts/pussy-hat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pussy Hat</a> for the ridiculously simple and fun hat you'll want to knit for every girl and woman on your list.
