  My girls and I love afternoon tea.  I grew up in colonial Hong Kong, and I have the fondest of memories of my mother and I spending afternoons at the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon over the prettiest tiers of finger sandwiches, little scones with Devonshire cream and jams, and of course my favorite Earl Grey tea in elegant Wedgewood tea cups.

  While there is a Governor's House a few towns over in Hyde Park, Vermont, with the loveliest of afternoon tea service offered by the ever-proper Inn Keeper, Suzanne Boden, my girls and I also enjoy our own little version at home.

  When we do, we either bring out our mugs from out mismatch collection, or our cute little pink-and-taupe ones from Pottery Barn purchased when my 17 year old was still in single digits.

  These little homemade brown sugar cubes in the cutest of shapes are an absolute love as hostess gifts.  Make them in shapes and flavors that fit the occasion, doll them up in a pretty jar, and you're ready to gift!

  I also make variations on the theme with Homemade Chai Sugar Cubes, which are perfect for hot cups of Double Spiced Chai with a touch of honey and soymilk.
