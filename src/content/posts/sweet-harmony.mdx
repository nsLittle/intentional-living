  I’m notoriously both lazy and busy. While I love the romance of an all-day simmering sauce—the slow bubblings of a pot on the stove, the kitchen filled with tantalizing scents—most days are too hectic for that kind of cooking.

  That’s where my jars of go-to spice mixes quietly save the day. Every so often, my younger daughter and I set aside a Saturday morning to measure, mix, and stir together a few favorite blends.

  It’s a simple ritual: spoonfuls of this and that, a little giggling over the measuring spoons, and neat rows of jars by the time we’re done. 

  Keeping a small stash of pre-made blends makes weeknights effortless.  A sprinkle on chicken or roasted vegetables, a quick sauté, a side or two—and dinner is on the table without the drama.
