  Our Chicken Noodle Soup mix captures the essence of home in every spoonful. Tender egg noodles blend seamlessly with savory minced onion, celery, and carrots, creating a medley of flavors that feels like a cozy hug on a chilly day.

  Infused with a delicate balance of rosemary, sage, thyme, and a hint of celery seed, the mix is elevated by the depth of chicken bouillon granules, with a single bay leaf offering a subtly earthy undertone. Simmer it with diced chicken and fresh vegetables for a hearty family meal, or keep it simple for a nourishing bowl of comfort.
