text: "My Southwest Heat seasoning mix is your ticket to bold, zesty, and smoky flavors that bring the heart of the Southwest straight to your kitchen. A perfect medley of chili powder, cumin, and smoked paprika delivers a warm, earthy base, while a hint of crushed red pepper adds just the right amount of fiery kick. Garlic, onion, and oregano round out the profile with savory depth, creating a blend that’s as versatile as it is vibrant."

Use it to spice up roasted veggies, grilled shrimp, or even sprinkle it over popcorn for a snappy snack with attitude.
