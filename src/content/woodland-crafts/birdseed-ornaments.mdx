  Every few seasons, my girls and I build fairy houses to scatter around our woods.  It's a little touch of whimsy that fills my heart when I'm outside breathing in the universe.

  Made with little bits of this and that, including buttons, dried moss, sea shells, pinecorns, ribbons, and other found bits from our craft room or the woods.
